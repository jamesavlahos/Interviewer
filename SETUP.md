# Setup Guide - Virtual Biographer

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Virtual Biographer application.

## Phase 1 MVP Complete! ‚úÖ

You now have:
- ‚úÖ Backend FastAPI relay server
- ‚úÖ Frontend React + TypeScript interface
- ‚úÖ Real-time voice conversation
- ‚úÖ OpenAI Realtime API integration
- ‚úÖ Clean UI with visual feedback

## Next Steps to Run

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (you'll need it in the next step)

**Note:** You need access to the Realtime API (GPT-4o realtime preview). This may require:
- A paid OpenAI account
- Access to the beta Realtime API

### Step 2: Configure Backend

```bash
cd /Users/jamesvlahos/Desktop/Code/Interviewer/backend
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
cd /Users/jamesvlahos/Desktop/Code/Interviewer/backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a new terminal tab/window:

```bash
cd /Users/jamesvlahos/Desktop/Code/Interviewer/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
cd /Users/jamesvlahos/Desktop/Code/Interviewer/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
cd /Users/jamesvlahos/Desktop/Code/Interviewer/frontend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 6: Test the Application

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173
2. You should see the Virtual Biographer interface
3. Click "Start Interview"
4. Allow microphone access when prompted
5. The interviewer will greet you and start the conversation!

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"OpenAI API key not found":**
- Make sure you edited `backend/.env` and added your key
- Make sure the key starts with `sk-`

**"Port 8000 already in use":**
- Change PORT in `.env` to a different number like 8001
- Update the WebSocket URL in `frontend/src/App.tsx` to match

### Frontend Issues

**"npm: command not found":**
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

**"Cannot connect to WebSocket":**
- Make sure the backend is running on port 8000
- Check browser console for error messages

**Microphone not working:**
- Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
- Make sure no other application is using your microphone
- Try in Chrome/Edge (best Web Audio API support)

### OpenAI API Issues

**"Invalid API key":**
- Verify your key is correct in `backend/.env`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces

**"Model not found":**
- You may not have access to the Realtime API yet
- Contact OpenAI support to request access

**High costs warning:**
- Realtime API is priced per minute of audio
- Monitor your usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## What's Next?

### Customizing the Interviewer

Edit `backend/main.py` and modify the `INTERVIEWER_PROMPT` variable (around line 53) to change:
- The interviewer's personality
- The types of questions asked
- The conversation style

### Phase 2 Features (Coming Soon)

- Google Sheets integration for dynamic prompts
- Post-session summarization
- Memory storage

## Testing Tips

1. **Test conversation flow:**
   - Say "Hello" and wait for response
   - Try interrupting the AI while it's speaking
   - Test with different question types

2. **Test audio quality:**
   - Use headphones to avoid echo/feedback
   - Speak clearly at normal volume
   - Check the status indicator changes

3. **Monitor costs:**
   - Keep sessions short during testing
   - Check OpenAI dashboard regularly
   - Set usage limits in OpenAI settings

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Backend shows "Connected to OpenAI Realtime API" in logs
‚úÖ Frontend status changes to "Listening..." when you speak
‚úÖ Avatar pulses when AI is speaking
‚úÖ Natural conversation flow with minimal latency

## Need Help?

Check the logs in both terminal windows for error messages. Most issues are related to:
1. Missing OpenAI API key
2. API access permissions
3. Microphone permissions
4. Port conflicts

Enjoy your Virtual Biographer! üéôÔ∏è
